## Chapter 3 demos on regression and L2 regularization

Below is a video tutorial illustrating how L2 regularization convexifies nonconvex cost functions, thereby making minimization of such functions easier.  The code (l2reg_logistic, which you may find here) shows the result of applying L2 regularization to a nonconvex form of logistic regression on a simple dataset, as well as the resulting convexificaation of this cost function due to regularization.   Again, some principles from the chapter - which is available for download at www.mlrefined.com -  are briefly described before jumping into the code.
