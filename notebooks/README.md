## Chap 1: 
* math background material - matrix operations, derivatives, geometry -  equation of line / hyperplane, quadratic forms
* numpy + matplotlib basics, etc., - can some of this be taken from other metis classes?  Seeing some good content in shared data science repo, plotting curves and surfaces with matplotlib
* Some of the equations look funny in browsers other than firefox  - universal way of fixing it?

## Chap 2:
* gradient descent intro

## Chap 3: 
* nonlinear feature transofmrs
* old-school logistic regression
