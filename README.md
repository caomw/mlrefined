# Machine Learning Refined code

In this repository you can find demo code written in Python and MATLAB for Chapters 2 - 8 from the textbook Machine Learning Refined.  You can download this chapter by visiting www.mlrefined.com

Current code demos include:

## Chapter 2 demos on gradient descent and Newton's method

Below is a video tutorial illustrating how gradient descent works via use of the demo code (convex_grad_surrogate and nonconvex_grad_surrogate, which you may find here) - these illustrate the basic concepts underlying gradient descent applied to minimizing both convex and nonconvex functions. Some principles from the chapter are briefly described before jumping into the code.
