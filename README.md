# mlrefined-Chap2
Code examples from chapter 2 - on the fundamentals of numerical optimization - from my textbook "Machine Learning Refined" (Cambridge University Press).  You can download this chapter by visiting www.mlrefined.com

## Demos

A video tutorial illustrating the use of the demo code - these illustrates the basic concepts underlying gradient descent applied to minimizing both convex and nonconvex functions.  Some principles from the chapter are briefly described before jumping into the code.
