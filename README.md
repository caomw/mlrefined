# mlrefined-Chap2
Python and MATLAB code examples from chapter 2 - on the fundamentals of numerical optimization including gradient descent and Newton's method - from my textbook "Machine Learning Refined" (Cambridge University Press).  You can download this chapter by visiting www.mlrefined.com

## Demos

A video tutorial illustrating how gradient descent works via use of the demo code (convex_grad_surrogate and nonconvex_grad_surrogate) - these illustrate the basic concepts underlying gradient descent applied to minimizing both convex and nonconvex functions.  Some principles from the chapter are briefly described before jumping into the code.
