# Machine Learning Refined code

In this repository you can find demo code written in Python and MATLAB for Chapters 2 - 8 from the textbook Machine Learning Refined.  You can download this chapter by visiting www.mlrefined.com

Current code demos include:

## Chapter 2 demos on gradient descent and Newton's method

Below is a video tutorial illustrating how gradient descent works via use of the demo code (convex_grad_surrogate and nonconvex_grad_surrogate, which you may find here) - these illustrate the basic concepts underlying gradient descent applied to minimizing both convex and nonconvex functions. Some principles from the chapter are briefly described before jumping into the code.

## Chapter 3 demos on regression and L2 regularization

Below is a video tutorial illustrating how L2 regularization convexifies nonconvex cost functions, thereby making minimization of such functions easier.  The code (l2reg_logistic, which you may find here) shows the result of applying L2 regularization to a nonconvex form of logistic regression on a simple dataset, as well as the resulting convexificaation of this cost function due to regularization.   Again, some principles from the chapter - which is available for download at www.mlrefined.com -  are briefly described before jumping into the code.
